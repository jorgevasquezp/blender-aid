The 2 main features of blender-aid are visibility and re-factoring.

Visibility presents technical data of a production in different ways, like the links between files or the output settings of files. Presenting the data in a useful way lets you see where and why a file is used. With this information it is possible to answer questions like: "What scenes needs to be re-rendered when you modify a file or a part of a file?".
